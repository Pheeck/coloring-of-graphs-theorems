# Theorems from Coloring of Graphs, MFF

This document is a list of theorems and definitions taught in the 2023/24 run
of the Coloring of Graphs and Other Combinatorial Structures lecture. I also
added some notes concerning the material where it seemed appropriate to me.
Good luck with the exam.

See releases for compiled pdf files. I welcome pull requests.
